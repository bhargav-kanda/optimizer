# optimizer
Python framework to formulate and solve for optimization problems. Built on sympy.

The framework lets you define an optimization problem symbolically and then input data to the model to create an instance of the formulation. It will also check for conflicts in constraints for the given data input. It is integrated with multiple solver backends to solve for the optimal solution. It supports partial solution and initial solution input.
